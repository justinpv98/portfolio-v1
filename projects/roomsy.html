            <h2>
                Process
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>The intention of this design was simply to expand further on my CSS skills. I found an interesting
                    design on Dribbble and wanted to replicate it. While the original design was elaborate and covered a
                    multi-page layout scheme, I wanted to focus mainly on improving front-end design without being
                    pushed to creating a back-end for it. The landing page was fairly complex as well and would make for
                    good
                    practice.</p>
                <p>The designing of the website was fairly simple. I followed the process of designing a website
                    mobile-first. The mobile design for the website was far simpler than the desktop design. The complex
                    part about it was developing a slider purely via CSS. By tackling overflow and using the power of
                    flexbox along with negative margins, it becomes fairly easy.</p>
                <p>Making the website desktop-friendly was the next concern, and was considerably more complex than its
                    mobile counterpart. The first slider had to be converted into a grid, and I had to make extensive
                    use of display: grid. The second slider had to be converted into two absolutely positioned blocks of
                    images. Finally, the container for the host call-to-action had to be rounded off which I tackled by
                    using two pseudoelements in the shape of background-matching semicircles. </p>

                Lessons Learned
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>Things that I could say I've learned from doing the Roomsy project:</p>
                <ol class="project-section__ol">
                    <li class="project-section__item">
                        <h3 class="project-section__header">Complex layouts don't need to be difficult layouts.</h3>
                        <p>What this means is just because something seems complex in how you would tackle it, doesn't
                            mean it has to be intimidating. The method I used to tackle the design of this project --
                            particularly in the call-to-action section was thinking how could I simplify the problem as
                            much as I could.</p>
                        <p>I had already accomplished making a slider for the category section, and I knew it mostly
                            just consisted of flex items. I also knew that the absolutely positioned cards would
                            technically be in two different containers. So, I solved my problem by simplying adding a
                            wrapper over the containers and setting it to flex, making the containers themselves flex,
                            and making the scroll snap to the individual cards.</p>
                        <p>All this required was simply thinking about the problem holistically and then separating it
                            into parts to tackle it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="project-section__item">
                        <h3 class="project-section__header">Improving my ability to replicate designs</h3>
                        <p>While I can by no means say that my design is pixel-perfect, after all the age of
                            pixel-perfect design in a world of responsitivty is nigh impossible, I would say that I have
                            gained a better ability to transfer a design from image or Figma file over to code. </p>
                        <p>A lot of the things we learn through life are through imitation. The idea of social learning
                            for example is a big theory in how we learn psychologically. This also extends to design and
                            UX. I feel like tackling this project in particular made me more cognizant of design and UX
                            considerations when it comes to color and layout.</p>

                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>Spending time to flesh out the Roomsy landing page has definitely helped me become more skilled when
                    it comes to real-world CSS layouts that I would be asked to create and replicate from a design. It
                    also taught me how to approach CSS problems much like one would with problems in a programming
                    language. Think about the problem holistically, break it into the steps, and go from there.</p>
